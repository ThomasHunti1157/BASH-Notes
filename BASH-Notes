        BASH Notes
 


     ##Overview
Bash stands for bourne again
widely used on linux
supports job control, commmand line editing, and command history
goal in bash is to automate tasks


##Linux commands and switches
    CTRL + P = up 
    CTRL + N = down
    CTRL + A = Start of a line
    CTRL + E = End of a line
    CTRL + U = backspace to delete everything
    CTRL + L = clears screen
    ALT + (F or B) = forward or back
    
    history = shows history (in numerical order)
    !! = last command ran
    reference command (! (number of line on history command))
    
    man bash = opens the extensive BASH man page
    man find = Opens man page for find command
    G = move to end of man page
    g = move to start of man page
    /pattern = Search forward for (N-th) matching line
    ?pattern = Search backward
    &pattern = display only matching lines
    bash [options] [command_string | file]
    n or shift+n = moves between search results
    q = quit man
    
    
                                BASH IS CASE SENSITIVE
                               
##ONLINE RESOURCES
    explainshell (breaks down command in linux and explains what that command is doing)  
    
    curl is a command line url request (way in linux to grab a webpage) (site designed to work with this (cheat.sh) 
    command =  (curl cht.sh/grep)

##ORDER OF EVALUATION
    1. Redirection (man bash (> or >>) bash.txt) instead of printing to the screen it redirects to a text file or creates a new one if it doens excist.) 
    2. Alias - give a nam to something that does a command (also have the baikity to create your own alias') (alias <command to be written over>='command')
    3. Parameter expansion, command - ./WIP.sh (to get info) runnning subshells in bash 
    4. Shell functions - (hello() { echo "hello from function";} run hello hits function **unless an alias is covering that command.
    5. Built-in commands - (help is a built in command) built in to bash
    6. Hash tables - (temporary cache)
    7.Path variable - way for you to tell it where to look (specify diffeent locations of where your at) (ls ~) 
    8. Error {eg command not found} - 
    
    ##BRACE EXPANSION
        -a way for you to group options to a command (ex: wanted to do an ls on multiple location (ls {BASH,SSH,ZIP}) **do not put spaces
        -ex: touch file{1..10}(<.log> to end to make type of these files) (if its a numeric increment you can do a .. such as 1 through 10) 


    ** use the type function to find what the command will do (type -a hello (outputs what that command will do and what the alias is) 
    **use unset hello to unalias a function.


##FILESYSTEM AND MANIPULATION
    -absolute, home, and relative file references
        home directory ~/ or $HOME
        absolute paths /etc/passwd
        relativep paths 
    -filesystem commmands
        touch, mkdir, rm, rmdir, ls, cd
    -Links
        symbolic link (shortcut pointer
        hard link (persistent cannot cross file systems
        
       
##PROCESSES AND MEMORY
    Process Hierarchy
      -Kernel
    Processes Snapshot
      -ps
    Terminating
      -kill, killall

##CAT, MORE || LESS
    
    cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output
      
    more - gives you less to begin with printing out only what you can see and go through the pages just like a book
      -space ot go to next page also tell hows far into it you are
    
    less - goes line by line (default when going through man
   
##FINDING FILES AND DIRS
    find command - searches files in a directroy hierarchy (find /
      locate, whereis, which, find
    locate will find something and where it is installed

##GREP
    grep - print lines matching a point
    ex: ls | grep .log
    ex: grep "-" man.txt (finds all the - in the given document)
    ex: grep -oc "-" man.txt (prints how many times the line occurs in the document)
    
    egrep - almost an alias for grep -e which is an extended regex allowing for the use of regex based patterns
    
    **always good to ply safe and put double quote ("") around objects

##CUT
    cut - remove sections from each line of files
    OPTIONS
      -d delimiter
      -f fields
      -c characters
      -s only delimited
      --output-delimiter
      ex: tail /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6
 
 
    ##EXCERSICES 1-5

Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated, for commands that will take multiple arguements. For the below examples, the first example is equivalent to the second command.

  mkdir {1123,1134,1145,1156}

Use Brace-Expansion to create the following files within the $HOME/1123 directory. You may need to create the $HOME/1123 directory. Make the following files, but utilze Brace Expansion to make all nine files with one touch command.

Files to create:

1.txt
2.txt
3.txt
4.txt
5.txt
6~.txt
7~.txt
8~.txt
9~.txt

  touch  1123/{1..5}.txt 1123/{6~,7~,8~,9~}.txt  or brac expansion within brace exansion 1123/{{1..5},{5..9}~}.txt

ist all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt. Omit the files containing a tilde (~) character.

While this activity can be accomplished with only find, it can also be combined with grep as well.

  find ~/1123 -name *.txt ! -name *~*



Using ONLY the find command, find all empty files/directories in directory /var and print out ONLY the filename (not absolute path), and the inode number, separated by newlines

  find /var -empty -printf "%i %f\n"
  
Using ONLY the find command, find all files on the system with inode 4026532575 and print only the filename to the screen, not the absolute path to the file, separating each filename with a newline. Ensure unneeded output is not visible.
  find / -inum 4026532575 -printf "%f\n"


Using only the ls -l and cut Commands, write a BASH script that shows all filenames with extensions ie: 1.txt, etc., but no directories, in $HOME/CUT.
Write those to a text file called names in $HOME/CUT directory.
Omit the names filename from your output.

    ls -l ~/CUT | cut -d. -s -f1,2 | cut -d' ' -f9 > ~/CUT/names
    

    ##FIND OPTIONS
    
-empty = find empty files in the given search
-inum = find files by their inode number
-printf = format option for what prints   
      %b - Print the argument while expanding backslash escape sequences.
      %q - Print the argument shell-quoted, reusable as input.
      %d, %i - Print the argument as a signed decimal integer.
      %u - Print the argument as an unsigned decimal integer.
      %o - Print the argument as an unsigned octal integer.
      %x, %X - Print the argument as an unsigned hexadecimal integer. %x prints lower-case letters and %X prints upper-case.
      %e, %E - Print the argument as a floating-point number in exponential notation. %e prints lower-case letters and %E prints upper-case.
      %a, %A - Print the argument as a floating-point number in hexadecimal fractional notation. %a prints lower-case letters and %A prints upper-case.
      %g, %G - Print the argument as a floating-point number in normal or exponential notation, whichever is more appropriate for the given value and precision. %g prints lower-case letters and %G prints upper-case.
      %c - Print the argument as a single character.
      %f - Print the argument as a floating-point number.
      %s - Print the argument as a string.
      %% - Print a literal % symbol.



    ##AWK
-scans a file line by line
-splits each input line into fields
-compare input lines

-used for transforming data files and produce formatted reports.
-USES: 
    awk '{print}' menu.txt
    awk '/latte/ {print}' menu.txt (prints any form of latte (will also print out anything else in that line))
-To delimit by whitespace ex: awk '{print} $1,$4}' coffeeshop.txt
                                             ^
                                     fields it was pslit up into
EX: tail /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $NF}'   (print last part of etc passwd LAST FIELD)
                            ^           ^ Number of fields 
                  input field seperator (lower f is the source file)
-NR option in print curly braces allows to add lines
EX: AWK 'NR==3, NR==7 {print NR,$0}' coffeeshop.txt    
    
    ##SORT
    
-Wont change actual file need to redirect
-sort will normally sort things alhanumeric starting with numbers then going to capital letter, then on to lower case.
-r will reverse
-k 2,4 will creae colmns specified.
-u will remove duplicates
**caps come before lower
-n sorts files with numbers in them (starts with negatives along with whitespace) 
-^ reverse = -nr

    ##SED
    
-sed 's/tea/coffee/<g>(replaces all instances)' beststuff.xt (changes instances of tea into coffee)
      ^             ^ replace this with a number will replace that instance of the change
 stands for substitution
**remember doesnt change unless outfiled

-sed '5 s/crazy/coffee/"
      ^
  changes that line


    ##uniq
-EX: uniq -c -i sortcoffee.txt
-line comparison from the line baove and the line before
-to do a complete unique comparison you must sort it before
-sort then pipe into unique then tweak


    ##conditionals
    
-used in a script to mach what to do
-e          file exists ?
-f          file exists, and is regular file ?
-d          file exists, and is a directory ?
-s          file exists, and is NOT empty ?
-x          file exists, and IS executable ?
-w          file exists, and is writable by me ?
-gt >       is greater than
-lt <       is less than
-ge         is greater than or equal to
-le         is less than or equal to
-eq ==      is equal to
-ne !=      is NOT equal to

-EX: if [[ -f /etc/passwd ]]; then

**remember which works with string and which with numbers
**!= is for strings, -ne for numbers

-!= symbols uses an alphanumeric equation
- using letters sych as -ne does an arithmetic comparison

    ##COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
    
-EX: A=$(tail /etc/passwd)
-if $A is ran it will run the command in that variable
-variables are only in that terminal (if you want persistence save it on your profile)


                ##BASH ACTIVITES 6-10
        ##6             
Write a basic bash script that greps ONLY the IP addresses in the text file provided (named StoryHiddenIPs in the current directory); sort them uniquely by number of times they appear.

It is not important to have a regular expression that only catches fully valid IP addresses. It is more important that you become familiar with creating and using regular expressions. Below, there are some useful websites that you can use to visually see what your regular expression pattern is matching on.

                egrep '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' -o StoryHiddenIPs | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

        ##7
Using ONLY the awk command, write a BASH one-liner script that extracts ONLY the names of all the system and user accounts that are not UIDs 0-3.
Only display those that use /bin/bash as their default shell.
The input file is named $HOME/passwd and is located in the current directory.
Output the results to a file called $HOME/SED/names.txt

                awk -F: '($4 > 3 && $NF == "/bin/bash") {print $1}' ~/passwd > ~/SED/names.txt
        ##8
Find all dmesg kernel messages that contain CPU or BIOS (uppercase) in the string, but not usable or reserved (case-insensitive)
Print only the msg itself, omitting the bracketed numerical expressions ie: [1.132775]

                dmesg | grep 'CPU\|BIOS' | egrep -v "(usable)|(reserved)" | cut -d] -f2,3
        ##9
Write a Bash script using "Command Substitution" to replace all passwords, using openssl, from the file $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt with the MD5 encrypted password: Password1234, with salt: bad4u
Output of this command should go to the screen/standard output.
You are not limited to a particular command, however you must use openssl. Type man openssl passwd for more information.

       #!/bin/bash

        a=$(openssl passwd -1 -salt bad4u Password1234)
        awk -F: -v "var=$a" 'BEGIN {OFS=":"} {$2=var} {print $0}' ~/PASS/shadow.txt
        ##10
Using ONLY sed, write all lines from $HOME/passwd into $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt that do not end with either /bin/sh or /bin/false.

                sed '/\/false/d' ~/passwd | sed '/\/sh/d' > ~/PASS/passwd.txt
                                           or
                sed -e '/\/bin\/false/d' -e '/\/bin\/sh/d' ~/passwd > ~/PASS/passwd.txt
                     ^
               combines multiple patterns provided

                ##DAY 3
                
                ##BASH PARAMETERS

-In a bash context, a parameter is an entity that stores a valu
        VARIABLE CAN BE
-NAME (variable)
-NUMBER (positional parameter)
-special character (special parameter)

(variable is a parameter denoted by a name)

                ##BASH PARAMETERS (VARIABLES)
                
-variables are parameters set with a name (identifier) on the left of an equal sign and a value (or nothing) on the right side. Variables are user defined
  **no spaces are allowed 
  
                ##SPECIAL PARAMETERS
                
-BASH includes several special parameters that you can use in your scripts.
.Builtin Variables

$*
The positional parameters, starting from one.

$@
The positional parameters, starting from one.

$#
The number of positional parameters.

$?
The exit status of the previous command.

$-
The current option flags of the shell.

$$
The process ID of the shell.

$!
The process ID of the most recent background job.

$0
$0 is set to the name of the script.

$_
First command in a script, is the path/name of the script as invoked.
  Otherwise, it is the last parameter passed to the most recent command.

                ##FUNCTIONS
                
-allow breaking of code up into a manageable chunker
-series of commands executed as if it wsas a single command.
**declare functions first

EX: myfunc() {
echo Hello I am a function
##This is a comment
}

-Calling a function EX: myfunc

**shell based functions (only ascessible in the shell created)

function getuser()
{
        echo "Make a choice [1,2,3]:"
        read userchoice
        case $userchoice in 
                (1) echo one ;;
                (2) echo two ;;
                (3) echo three ;;

               ##ACTIVITY 11
               Using find, find all files under the $HOME directory with a .bin extension ONLY.
Once the file(s) and their path(s) have been found, remove the file name from the absolute path output.
Ensure there is no trailing / at the end of the directory path when outputting to standard output.
You may need to sort the output depending on the command(s) you use.
               
find ~/ -name "*.bin" | rev | cut -d/ -f2- | rev | sort | uniq
                                or
find $HOME -name "*.bin" | awk 'BEGIN{FS="/";OFS="/"}{NF=NF-1; print $0}' | sort -u |uniq 

               
               ##ACTIVITY 12
               Write a script which will copy the last entry/line in the passwd-like file specified by the $1 positional parameter
Modify the copied line to change:
User name to the value specified by $2 positional parameter
Used id and group id to the value specified by $3 positional parameter
Home directory to a directory matching the user name specified by $2 positional parameter under the /home directory
The default shell to `/bin/bash'
Append the modified line to the end of the file
                
passwd_file=$1
username=$2

                ##ACTIVITY 13
                Find all executable files under the following four directories:
/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
Sort the filenames with absolute path, and get the md5sum of the 10th file from the top of the list.

commandsub=$(find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin -type f -executable | sort | head -10 | tail -1)

                ##ACTIVITY 14
                Sort the /etc/passwd file numerically by the GID field.
For the 10th entry in the sorted passwd file, get an md5 hash of that entry’s home directory.
Output ONLY the MD5 hash of the directory's name to standard output.

awk -F: '{print $4,$6}' /etc/passwd | sort -n | head | tail -1 | awk -F " " '{print $2}' | md5sum | awk -F " " '{print $1}'

                ##ACTIVITY 15
                Write a script which will find and hash the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories: /bin /etc /var
Your script should:
Exclude named pipes. These can break your script.
Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
Determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.
Determine the count of unsuccessfully hashed directories.
Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.

                ##DAY 4 ACTIVITIES 
                ##ACTIVITY 16
                
Design a script that detects the existence of directory: $HOME/.ssh

Upon successful detection, copies any and all files from within the directory $HOME/.ssh to directory $HOME/SSH and produce no output. You will need to create $HOME/SSH.
Upon un-successful detection, displays the error message "Run ssh-keygen" to the user.

if [ -d $HOME/.ssh ]
then
        mkdir $HOME/SSH
        cp -R $HOME/.ssh/. $HOME/SSH/.
    
else 
    
        echo Run ssh-keygen
fi

                ##ACTIVITY 17
                
Write a script that determines your default gateway ip address. Assign that address to a variable using command substitution.
NOTE: Networking on the CTFd is limited for security reasons. ip route and route are emulated. Use either of those with no switches.
Have your script determine the absolute path of the ping application. Assign the absolute path to a variable using command substitution.
Have your script send six ping packets to your default gateway, utilizing the path discovered in the previous step, and assign the response to a variable using command substitution.
Evaluate the response as being either successful or failure, and print an appropriate message to the screen.

A=$(ip route | head -1 | cut -d" " -f3)
B=$(which ping)
C=" 0% packet loss" 
D=$($B -c 6 $A | grep -Eo "$C")
if [[ "$C" == "$D" ]];
    then  
        echo "successful";
    else 
        echo "failure";
fi

                ##ACTIVITY 18
                        
                        
Create the following files in a new directory you create $HOME/ZIP:
file1 will contain the md5sum of the text 12345
file2 will contain the md5sum of the text 6789
file3 will contain the md5sum of the text abcdef
Create a zip file containing the three files above, without being stored inside a directory in the zip file. Name the zip file $HOME/ZIP/file.zip
HINT: "Junk" the paths
Utilize tar on $HOME/ZIP/file.zip to archive it into a file called $HOME/ZIP/file.tar.gz which should not include directories. Use the gzip option in tar, DO NOT use a seperate gzip binary.
HINT: You might need an option to change directories first.


mkdir $HOME/ZIP
touch $HOME/ZIP/file{1..3}
echo '12345' | md5sum | cut -d" " -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file1
echo '6789' | md5sum | cut -d" " -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file2
echo 'abcdef' | md5sum | cut -d" " -f1 > $HOME/ZIP/file3

zip $HOME/ZIP/file.zip $HOME/ZIP/* -jq 
cd $HOME/ZIP/
tar -czvf $HOME/ZIP/file.tar.gz file.zip
